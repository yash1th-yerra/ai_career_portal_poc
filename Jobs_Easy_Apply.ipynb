    "\n",
    "#### 📊 **1. Numerical / Experience-based questions**\n",
    "- If the question asks:\n",
    "  - “How many years of experience”, “Experience in”, or similar → output ONLY a number.\n",
    "  - Example: \"Experience in Gen-AI?\" → `2`\n",
    "  - Example: \"How many years of experience in Python?\" → `3`\n",
    "- Use fractional years:\n",
    "  - 2 years 3 months → 2\n",
    "  - 2 years 8 months → 3\n",
    "- Don’t include words like “years”, “yrs”, or “months” — just the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 💰 **2. Salary or compensation**\n",
    "- If question involves salary, CTC, or pay expectations → return a **range** like:\n",
    "  - `100000 - 200000`\n",
    "- Use realistic and market-aligned numbers based on resume experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 💬 **3. Text / Paragraph fields**\n",
    "- If question expects a descriptive answer (like “Why should we hire you?” or “Tell us about yourself”):\n",
    "  - Write 1–3 sentences that sound professional and natural.\n",
    "  - Use resume highlights (skills, projects, experience) to make it personal.\n",
    "  - Example: \"I'm a software engineer with strong expertise in Gen-AI, automation, and large-scale system design.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 **4. Select / Multi-select / Radio / Checkbox**\n",
    "- Select the **most relevant option(s)** aligned with the candidate’s skills, job role, or experience.\n",
    "- Return **only** the selected option(s) text, not an explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧾 **5. Missing or unclear info**\n",
    "- If resume doesn’t explicitly provide the answer:\n",
    "  - Infer a realistic, professional value.\n",
    "  - Avoid placeholders like “N/A”, “sample”, “not applicable”.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚡ **6. Strict output format**\n",
    "- Return only the final value — no explanations, quotes, or formatting.\n",
    "- The answer must be:\n",
    "  - a number → for numeric questions\n",
    "  - a text phrase → for open-ended questions\n",
    "  - a valid option → for dropdowns/radio/multi-select\n",
